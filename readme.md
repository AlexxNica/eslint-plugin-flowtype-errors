eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors
=============================
Get Flowtype errors as ESLint errors!

## Demo
![ESLint Flow Demo](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors/blob/master/flow-demo.gif?raw=true)

## Why?
* Less editor configuration: All you need is an eslint reporter plugin. No need to install flow specific tools!
* Simple: Its literally just an ESLint rule! Just install the dependency, add a flowconfig, and you're good to go!

## Planned Implementations
* Add Tests
* Add Windows support
* Run flow minimal amount of times

## Caution
**Highly experimental!**
**Windows is not supported at the moment!**
